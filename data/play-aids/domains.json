    "Criminal": "Breaking the law is a popular pastime in Reves, and the Criminal domain gives you an edge: it comes with knowledge of who's who, how to carry yourself, how to pick out a mark and how to stay one step ahead of the LEOD. Use Criminal when you're dealing with criminals — whether investigating them or trying to work alongside them — or in crime-heavy districts such as Pennies.",
    "Low Society": "Most of the city is covered by the Low Society domain — these worker, labourers, and craftsmen are the lifeblood of the city. They're also the parasitic and workshy masses, depending on who you ask.",
    "High Society": "Many of the tycoons, magnates, and moguls live in gilded luxury behind strong walls and ranks of private security. Money and how to spend is is a big part of the High Society domain, but more important than money is the indefinable quality known as class. You can have all the money you desire and still not be accepted into the right clubs if you don't know how to carry yourself — and with the High Society domain, you do.",
    "Weirdness": "The Procyon sector hums with the Way's energy and is filled with remnants of the ancient Ur. Using the Way, recalling ancient legends, and identifying Ur-artefacts all come under the Weirdness domain.",
    "Hegemony": "This domain encompasses those who keep the peace in and around Reves, successfully or not. The LEOD, for the most part, but also the Astral Guard, and the Board. Depending on who a mercenary works for, and the sort of work they do, they'll either be Hegemony or Criminal.",
    "Science": "Reves is on the bleeding edge of technology. The Science domain covers working with or repairing electronics, machinery, and software, as well as biological, chemical, and medical knowledge."
